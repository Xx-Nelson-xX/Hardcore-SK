First, I would like to thank the artists and developers of all the mods used in Hardcore SK.

Rimworld is about telling a story - about overcoming difficulties which your colonists will encounter on a mostly-untamed planet. The more variety of challenges they face, the more interesting your story will be, and this is what makes Rimworld worth playing again and again.

The idea for this project came to me after playing with mod packs. I discovered that although there are many great mods out there, game balance becomes messy and there are often bugs and incompatabilities when they're all played together. Hardcore SK offers a carefully curated list of mods which are optimized, balanced and maintained by myself and a team of modders, in additional to an abundance of original content which we continuously create.

The focus of Hardcore SK is to add a growing complexity to gameplay while immersing the player deep in the story. What awaits you is an improved and elaborate production chain, over 100 technologies to research, new events and challenges to face, impressive new foods, wardrobe and arsenal, enhanced AI features, quality of life options, and virtually everything retextured. As soon as you make landfall, you'll understand immediately that this is no longer just modded Rimworld - this is Hardcore SK. The campfire welcomes you.

This project has language support for English, Russian, and partial support for Spanish and Korean. Chinese translation available via a separate [mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2469653495).

## DOWNLOADING

### Project launcher (Windows only)

* **Download installer:** <https://hardcore-sk.ru/installer/HSK-Launcher-Setup.exe>
* **Mirror:** <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jk8Rv1Vy30_aY1ZHNA9whCnFxyeW8eSU>

#### Features

* Update HSK (Hardcore SK) in just a few clicks!
* Optional update Modconfig if needed.
* Option to launch game via Steam or direct path.
* Ability to check for new updates at startup.
* Ability to update HSK with using downloaded github master tree archive (if launcher for some reason couldn't download it).

#### Requirements

* If Rimworld was installed for the first time, you need to start it before updating HSK. (The game at startup generates configuration files).
* [Net Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653) (goes by default since Windows 8. There is no support for Windows XP and previously released OS).

It will ask for the RimWorld executable location.

For Windows users:

* Steam usually stores it in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\RimWorldWin64.exe`

### Manual installation

[Master:](https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK/tree/master) - The stable version/branch of the modpack usually a version behind the latest Rimworld. Currently for version 1.2.

[Development:](https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK/tree/development) - The work-in-progress version which contains the latest content for the latest version of rimworld, but is more likely to contain bugs. Currently for version 1.3.

1. Install either the [development](https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK/tree/development) or [master](https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK/tree/master) branch of the modpack.

2. Go to the folder you installed the game in and delete all mods inside your `Rimworld\Mods\` folder.

3. Open up the downloaded Hardcore SK .zip file. Extract everything in the `Hardcore-SK-master\Mods\` OR `Hardcore-SK-Development\Mods\` folder into your empty `Rimworlds\Mods\` folder.

4. Go to the RimWorld config folder and delete all the files that exist in that folder. Copy "`ModsConfig.xml`", which is at the root of the archive modpack. 

For Windows users:

* `C:\Users\your user name\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config`
* Or `windows button + R` -> the Run dialog will appear and then type `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow` -> this will open the appdata folder

For Linux users: `/home/your user name/.config/unity3d/Ludeon Studios/RimWorld/Config`

For Mac users: `/Users/your user name/Library/Application Support/RimWorld/Config`

5. Check mods at the title screen - turn on optional mods or disable ones you don't want. Switch Language if needed. Play!

6. Have fun üòÄ  

## RimWorld ReShade Guide

ReShade is often thought to be for games in 3D space, such as PUBG and Skyrim. However, ReShade is versatile enough to work with Rimworld and can have stunning results.
